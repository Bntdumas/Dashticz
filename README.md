# Dashticz
Dashboard addon for Domoticz

To install Dashticz, you should have access to the installation directory of Domoticz.
If Domoticz is installed on a Synology NAS, you could create a symbolic link for easier access.
In my case I used to following command through SSH:

mount -o bind /usr/local/domoticz /volume1/Rob/Domoticz/

Once you have access to the directory, create a subfolder named 'dash' (or any other foldername you want) in the www-folder. Extract the files from the ZIP-file you've just downloaded into this folder.

In /js/dashticz.js there are some configuration-options you can set.
If you don't want to use the Kodi/XBMC-functions, leave this variable empty.

If you want to interact with Kodi/XBMC, create a PHP-file on a webserver, with the following code and replace the IP-address of Kodi:

Last but not least, Dashticz is accessible via http://DOMOTICZ_IP:PORT/YOUR_FOLDERNAME/index.html
(Do not forget index.html in the end of the URL. For some reason Domoticz-webserver not automatically opens index.html)

WARNING!!
After a Domoticz-update, you have to re-upload Dashticz.
Domoticz removes the whole folder!

#Frequently Asked Questions
<b>How do I get the day/night icon in the top right of the screen?</b><br />
In Domoticz, add a dummy switch with a name of your choice. Set a timer so it goes on at sunrise and goes out on sunset.
Fill in the name of this dummy switch in Dashticz's settings.

<b>How to use Dashticz if Domoticz is password protected?</b><br />
Go to Dashticz's settings via the cog-icon in the top right of the screen.
Fill in the full path for Domoticz, e.g.: http://username:password@192.168.1.3:8084 (withouth trailing slash)

<b>When Domoticz is updated, it has removed Dashticz?!</b><br />
Unfortunately, Dashticz has to be installed into Domoticz's www-directory.
When Domoticz installs an update, it complete removes the www-directory, before placing the updated version back. Currently, there is no solution for this, youhave to re-install Dashticz.
